This is a jupyter notebook using Time Series Method (Triple Exponential Smoothing) for forecasting total bandwidth of a company providing entertainment platform for music, video, live stream, chat, etc. As the dataset is only train set, so I split train set to train-tuning, val-tuning and test set in notebook.
